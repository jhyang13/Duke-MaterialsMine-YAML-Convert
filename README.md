# MaterialsMine_YAMLconvert

## Project Overview
This project contains two Python scripts designed for converting between XML and YAML file formats. These scripts are particularly useful for handling structured data in the field of materials science, allowing easy conversion of data from XML to YAML format and vice versa.

## Usage Notes
- These scripts assume that the input XML and YAML files are well-formed and adhere to the expected structure. Please ensure the file formats are correct to avoid errors during the conversion process.
- If you encounter errors during conversion, review the structure of your files to ensure that element names are valid and conform to XML standards.
